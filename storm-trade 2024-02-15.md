The Onboarding team is responsible for reducing the time required to create MVPs for developers across the entire TON ecosystem. Their main focus is to provide developers with all the necessary materials they need along the path to creating an MVP. This includes everything from the Developer Portal and TON Documentation to YouTube videos, courses, articles, and dedicated learning portals.
